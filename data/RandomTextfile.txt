iphone 17 review
The standard Apple iPhone 17, released in September 2025, is a significant step up from its predecessors and is well-regarded by reviewers. The upgrade is particularly notable for its enhanced display, larger battery life, and improved camera system, bridging the feature gap with the more expensive Pro models. 
Top pros and cons
Reviews highlight major upgrades that make the iPhone 17 the "best iPhone for the money," according to PCMag Middle East. 
Pros
120Hz ProMotion display: The standard model finally gets an adaptive refresh rate display, previously exclusive to the Pro lineup. This enables smoother scrolling, more fluid gaming, and an always-on display.
Superior battery life: The iPhone 17's battery life is rated for up to 30 hours of video playback, a substantial improvement over the iPhone 16's 22 hours.
Improved camera system: The ultrawide camera gets a resolution boost to 48 megapixels, and the front-facing "Center Stage" camera is upgraded to 18 megapixels with a square sensor that is great for selfies and video calls.
More storage for the same price: The entry-level model now comes with 256GB of storage, doubling the base capacity of the iPhone 16 at the same starting price point.
Faster charging speeds: Wired charging has been improved, allowing the phone to reach 50% charge in about 20 minutes with a compatible adapter.

Cons
Minimal design change: The external design is largely unchanged from the iPhone 16, aside from slightly larger dimensions due to a bigger screen and rounded edges.
Lacks Pro camera features: The phone does not include the telephoto lens, vapor chamber cooling, or the more powerful A19 Pro chip found in the iPhone 17 Pro.
Oversaturated photo colors: According to PhoneArena, the iPhone 17's default photo processing can sometimes produce colors that are more saturated and less natural-looking than on the iPhone 16. 

Who should consider buying the iPhone 17?
Users of older iPhones (14 or earlier): You will see a dramatic improvement in display quality, battery life, camera performance, and overall speed. It's a "very timely upgrade" for anyone holding onto an older device.
iPhone 16 owners who want a 120Hz display: For those who missed the ProMotion display on the previous model, the iPhone 17 is a meaningful update without the Pro price tag.
Photographers and video creators: The upgrades to both the ultrawide and front-facing cameras, including the new Dual Capture video feature, make the iPhone 17 a more capable tool.
Anyone seeking great value: With doubled storage and many Pro-level features at the same starting price as the iPhone 16, the iPhone 17 is a strong value proposition.
